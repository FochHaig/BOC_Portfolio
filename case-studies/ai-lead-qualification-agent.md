# AI Lead Qualification Agent

## 🧩 Context
A client handling high inbound lead volumes needed a way to qualify leads automatically based on debt information and other criteria before routing them to sales.

## 🎯 Objective
Develop an AI-driven qualification system that evaluates leads, classifies them by debt thresholds, and determines next-step actions without human intervention.

## ⚙️ Solution
- Built an OpenAI-powered conversational agent that asks relevant screening questions.
- Configured logic to classify leads (e.g., debts > $300k, presence of liens, etc.).
- Automated lead routing and CRM tagging based on AI responses.
- Integrated the system with the client’s CRM via Zapier for seamless data flow.

## 💡 Impact
- Reduced manual lead screening by **90%**.
- Increased response speed and qualification consistency.
- Allowed sales teams to focus only on high-potential leads.

## 🧰 Tools Used
OpenAI API, Zapier, Google Sheets / CRM Integration, Python (data handling)

## 🧠 Takeaway
AI can complement — not replace — structured business rules. When aligned with workflow logic, it enables smarter client management at scale.
