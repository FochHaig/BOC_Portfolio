# CRM and Billing Automation Migration (Zoho Suite)

## 🧩 Context
The client was migrating from a legacy CRM to Zoho CRM and needed a unified process to prevent missed billings, double charges, and untracked client engagements.  
Before the migration, billing and client management were handled manually across multiple tools, creating visibility issues.

## 🎯 Objective
Design a CRM-centric process that automatically triggers engagement letters, tracks their signing, and initiates billing only for valid, active engagements.

## ⚙️ Solution
- Created structured data fields in Zoho CRM that mirror the client’s SOP checkpoints (e.g., Engagement Letter Sent → Signed → Billable).
- Automated transitions between CRM modules and linked them to billing systems (Zoho Books / Billing.com).
- Built validation layers to prevent duplicate or missed billings.
- Introduced internal offboarding workflow templates for consistent client lifecycle management.

## 💡 Impact
- Reduced manual billing errors by **~80%**.
- Improved transparency across engagement, billing, and finance teams.
- Created a replicable CRM framework for future automation across departments.

## 🧰 Tools Used
Zoho CRM, Zoho Books, Workflow Rules, Webhooks, Custom Functions, API Integrations

## 🧠 Takeaway
Building process logic directly within the CRM ensures that automation aligns with real operational checkpoints, not just technical triggers.
